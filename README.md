# Chat Buddy
A chatbot I made for my 8th-grade science fair

This chatbot is geared towards people with autism and even more closely teenagers with autism.

For the model, run the command ```wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-alpha-GGUF/resolve/main/zephyr-7b-alpha.Q8_0.gguf```

The model is @the-bloke's 8-bit quantization of Zephyr 7B
