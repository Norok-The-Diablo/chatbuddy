# Chat Buddy
A chatbot I made for my 8th-grade science fair

This chatbot is geared towards explaining thought process while helping with educational questions, kind of like an open source Khanmigo

For the model, run the command: ```wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-beta-GGUF/resolve/main/zephyr-7b-beta.Q8_0.gguf``` If you have 16 GB of VRAM or normal RAM

If you only have 8 GB of RAM/VRAM run this command: ```wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-beta-GGUF/resolve/main/zephyr-7b-beta.Q4_K_M.gguf```, and then change the model to ```zephyr-7b-beta.Q4_K_M.gguf```

The model is [@TheBloke's](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke) quantizations of Zephyr 7B, which is currently the best-performing small model.

This is a data table after running some tests with this criteria:

Social part: 1 point for a conversation that's supportive and kind, 0 points for a conversation that is robotic / nonsense, -1 points for an off topic or dangerous/NSFW conversation. 
Math and Science part: 1 point for explaining the problem with the chain of thought and getting it right, 0 points for just giving the answer, 0.5 points for getting the answer wrong but explaining chain of thought, -1 points for wrong and not explaining chain of thought. 
Literature part: 1 point for good analysis or explanation, 0.5 points for attempting to analyze but missing key points or not fully explaining thoughts, 0 points for giving a simple summary or not engaging with the deeper aspects of the text, -1 points for completely incorrect interpretations or unrelated responses.
